# MySQLWPF
WPF application as a practical exploration of accessing MySQL databases hosted on remote servers. The app features functionality for selecting a continent and a country, displaying the cities currently stored in the database. Additionally, an "add" window has been implemented to facilitate the addition of new cities for the selected country.
